        <h1>Bougainvillea</h1>
        <p>A favorite in tropical locales, this colorful climber can also be grown annually if you don't happen to live
            in a sunny spot. Bougainvillea can grow 20â€“30 feet tall and wide, and its beautiful color-saturated flowers
            make a major impact.

            Bloom season: In warm zones, bougainvillea can grow year-round; in colder climates, the vine blooms in the
            summer and should be brought in for the winter.</p>

    <div class="box2 box containt">
        <h1>Wisteria</h1>
        <p>If there was ever a flower to make you feel like you've wandered into a Jane Austen novel, wisteria is it.
            Not only does this climbing vine look romantic, it smells amazing too and will fill the space with color and
            fragrance. Be sure to opt for a North American species if you live in the states.

            Bloom season: Plant between October and April in full sun, the flowers should reach their peak in late
            spring and summer.

        <h1>Cosmos</h1>
        <p>
            Wispy and delicate, these daisy-shaped flowers seem almost weightless stop their super-long stems (which can
            grow up to 60 inches tall! Stake them for added support). Wedding florists love to tuck them into otherwise
            staid bouquets for a bit of happy whimsy; you should do the same for tabletop arrangements.

            Bloom season: Start seeds indoors, before the last frost, so you can transplant them outdoors when 3-4
            inches tall. Expect flowers in summer and fall. (If you lead the seed heads blow away, they'll self-sow
            elsewhere on your property.)</p>

    <div class="box4 box containt ">
        <h1>Gardenia</h1>
        <p>Known for its rich scent, this waxy flower with glossy thick leaves is often used in perfumes. An evergreen
            shrub that can grow 8 feet tall, gardenias grow best in humid areas.

            Bloom season: They can bloom during different seasons depending on the variety. Many appear in the spring
            and summer</p>
